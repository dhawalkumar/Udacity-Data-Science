## About
Saprkify is a music streaming app, which is not real, but it could represent any app. Thus doing predictive analysis would help gain useful insights about the users, thus making it easier for users for various things regarding the app.I used data provided by udacity ,to analyze and gain some insights regarding various questions that I had.
I did some exploratory data analysis, feature engineering and modeling with the data.
For modeling I used vector assembler and some classification algorithms.
The code through which I analyzed the data is in `Sparkify.ipynb`. I basically alalyzed the data . 

## Conclusion
Using pyspark enabled this vast dataset to be analyzed and extract useful information from it. Driver memory allocated by pyspark is as less as 1gb, but smart operations like dropping data frames after the visualization or required task are over can result in perfect working on large datasets such as these in an economical way. This kind of model can be run on a periodical basis, such once in every month or so to gain new insights very often.
