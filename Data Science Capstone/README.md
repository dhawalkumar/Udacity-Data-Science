## Introduction
For the Capstone Project, I worked upon “Optimizing App Offers With Starbucks” project, which means alalyzing what offers to be sent to what customers.

The code through which I analyzed the data is in `Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb`. I basically alalyzed what offers among what kind of people are causing the loss of revenue in company. With the observations I came through, I was able to deduce what changes can be made regarding offers. 

## Questions
These are the questions I am trying to solve:
1)How much do we tend to loss owing to the “unnecessary offer”?
2)What kind of customers that often complete the offer without viewing it?
3)How is the financial gain differentiate between customers type?

## Conclusion
The company is bearing a loss of $49,032 of revenue in a single month and $588,384 in a year. Thus working on offer selection and process needs work.

It is also observed that customers who use their offer without viewing have higher average income($71,060) than those who do($67,642).

Female customers generally complete their offers even without viewing them. As observed from the data, the average spending of female customers per transaction is $16,3 compared to male customers with $10,4 only. Thus generally, female customers spend more than male customers.

## Recommendation and Future Improvements
The company should be more careful in sending offers to customers, as alone BOGO caused the loss of $31,230.So, the best possible course of action is to limit the BOGO offers by sending them to only a few customers. One of the ways those limited sets of customers can be selected is to analyze which customers have average purchase value more than the price of 2 cups per transaction.

We deduced that the average spending per transaction for females is higher than Male and Others, with an average of USD 16,3 per transaction. Thus sending fewer discount offers to females would do the task. Another thing that can be done is increasing the minimum spending value for females.

We might wish to customize the "difficulty" based on the amount of financial gain for every client, so folks with higher financial gain have the more significant "difficulty" further.
