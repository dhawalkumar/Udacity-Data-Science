## Introduction
For the Capstone Project, I chose the “Optimizing App Offers With Starbucks” project, which basically trying is to solve the problem on how to send the offer to the right customers.

The complete step by step of my analysis are in the jupyter notebook, the medium article will show you the result of my analysis. For this project, I only focus on analyzing the “unnecessary offer” that was being sent. It is the offer that is sent to the customers, and they didn’t see it, yet somehow they still complete it (the offer completed if the customers spend a certain amount of money in a certain period of time, no matter they saw the offer or not).

## Questions
These are the questions I am trying to solve:
1)How much do we tend to loss owing to the “unnecessary offer”?
2)What kind of customers that often complete the offer without viewing it?
3)How is the financial gain differentiate between customers type?

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis, there are many things we can conclude.
With the unplanned supply, we can “loss” up to USD forty-nine thousand and thirty two of revenue in an exceedingly month or USD 588,384 of income in an exceedingly year. Therefore the target marketing of our promo is vital and plays a significant role.
Female customers tend to pay over Male customers, with the common defrayal per dealings is USD 16,3 compared to USD 10, 4 severally. Female customers even tend to finish the offer even while not viewing it 1st; thus, we’d need to be additional careful in providing the offer to them.
Overall, customers who complete the offer while not viewing the offer 1st have the upper average financial gain, particularly in discount offer wherever those that complete the offer while not considering it and people who saw it have average financial gain USD 71,060 and USD 67,642 respectively.

## Recommendation and Future Improvements
We need to be extra careful in sending the offer, mainly the BOGO offer wherever it contributes USD 31,230 loss during this experiment. One thing we might do to prevent giving the BOGO offer is to the customers with the standard purchase > a pair of cups per dealings, as a result of while not giving them the offer they tend to buy > a couple of cups anyway, therefore, the BOGO offer appears to be not vital for them.
Send less offers to the female customers, particularly. We will see from the info that the common defrayal of female customers is USD 16,3. Therefore, we would wish to extend the minimum defrayal for the provide we tend to send to them; as a result, it won’t add up if we manage to send them the offer with “difficulty” of USD ten accomplishes it anyway. Therefore increase the minimum purchase to USD twenty or USD twenty-five would be higher.
We might wish to customize the “difficulty” based on the amount of financial gain for every client, so folks with the upper financial gain have the greater “difficulty” further.
