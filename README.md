Introduction
The dataset used in this article is Stack Overflow Survey Data 2019 to answer questions like how satisfied developers are with their respective current locations of work and with their salary. This is the link to the StackOverflow dataset that I used.

these are three questions that I am going to answer in this article:
1. Which country has the best job satisfaction for developers?
2. Is there a distinction in job satisfaction between developers whose college major is IT-related and those that aren’t?
3. Are there any variations in terms of earnings between people that contribute to open source and people who are not?


Result Summary
After I did the analysis, these are the conclusion I found:

United States has the highest job satisfaction level for developers in the world, and 5 of top 10 countries with the highest job satisfaction level are located in Europe.
Developers whose undergraduate major is not IT-related have slightly better job satisfaction.
Developers who contribute more to the open source have the higher salary (although ”does it have the direct causation?” is still debatable).
