# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

You can check the running web app in this [link](view6914b2f4-3001.udacity-student-workspaces.com) .

## Prerequisites
### Libraries
To be able to run this project, you need to install the required libraries in the `requirements.txt`. Run the command below.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Introduction
In this project, we are going to build a web app to classify disaster responce messages. There are three major steps in this project.

### 1. ETL Process
We merge the dataset in the `data` folder (`disaster_messages.csv` and `disaster_categories.csv`), then do some preprocessing to get the clean data. We store the clean data in sqlite database `DisasterResponse.db`.

### 2. Training Model
Using scikit-learn, then we train the classifier to be able to get a model which can classify a message, save the model in the `models` folder with the name `classifier.pkl`(which cannot
be uploaded to github because of size restrictions. Orignal size of the file=207MB)

### 3. Run the Web App
Using flask, we can run our model and deploy in the website so that people can manually type the message and see its category. 

## Instructions
1. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        ```
        python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/DisasterResponse.db
        ```
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        ```
        python models/train_classifier.py data/DisasterResponse.db models/classifier.pkl
        ```

2. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app. 
```
python run.py

3. Now, open another Terminal Window.
```
Type

env|grep WORK
```
you will get spaceID and spacedomain.
```
Thus the URL of your webapp would be https://SPACEID-3001.SPACEDOMAIN

In my case it is https://view6914b2f4-3001.udacity-student-workspaces.com/
